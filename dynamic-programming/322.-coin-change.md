# 322. Coin Change

## Tips

* Greedy method doesn't work because it may not be optimal to use as many large elements as possible.
* Be careful with index out of bound exception.
* Deal with the situation where some amount i cannot be broken into some number of coins. Be careful with Integer.MAX\_VALUE and integer overflow.

## Problem Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        // init
        int[][] M = new int[2][amount + 1];
        for (int j = 1; j <= amount; j++) {
            M[0][j] = j % coins[0] == 0 ? j / coins[0] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        // dynamic programming
        for (int i = 1; i < coins.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= amount; j++) {
                if (j - coins[i] >= 0) {
                    if (M[1][j - coins[i]] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                        M[1][j] = M[0][j];
                    } else {
                        M[1][j] = Math.min(M[0][j], M[1][j - coins[i]] + 1);
                    }
                } else {
                    M[1][j] = M[0][j];
                }
            }
            int[] tmp = M[0];
            M[0] = M[1];
            M[1] = tmp;
        }
        return M[0][amount] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : M[0][amount];
    }
}

/*
M[i][j]: the minimum number of coins needed to reach amount j with the last coin as coins[i]
Base case: M[0][0] = 0, M[0][j] = j % coins[i] == 0 ? j / coins[i] : inf
Induction rule:
    Case 1: j - coins[i] >= 0
        M[i][j] = min(M[i - 1][j], M[i][j - coins[i]] + 1)
    Case 2: j - coins[i] < 0
        M[i][j] = M[i - 1][j]

return M[coins.length - 1][j]

Time: O(amount * coins.length)
Space: O(amount * coins.length) -> O(amount)
