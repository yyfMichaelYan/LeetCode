# 1. Two Sum

## Tips

* Read problem description carefully. Take appropriate strategy \(map, set, sort, two pointers\).

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have _**exactly**_ **one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(target - nums[i])) {
                return new int[]{map.get(target - nums[i]), i};
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
}

/*
Use a map to store visited numbers and indices
For each number,
    Case 1: (target - number) is visited
        return result
    Case 2: (target - number) is NOT visited
        add number to the set
return {-1, -1}

n is the length of nums
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
