# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Tips

## Problem Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int price : prices) {
            if (price >= minPrice) {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
            } else {
                minPrice = price;
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}

/*
Linearly scan the array while maintaining the minimum and max profit
For each element,
    Case 1: >= min
        calculate profit and udpate if necessary
    Case 2: < min
        update min
return max profit

n is the length of the input array
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
