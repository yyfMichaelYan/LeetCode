# 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

## Tips

* Time complexity is O\(V + E\) because every edge is visited once. If a node B is visited when exploring node A, the edge between A and B is used. When exploring B, since the hash map has B, meaning that B has been visited, the edge will not be used again from B to A.

## Problem Description

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

* There are no self-edges \(`graph[u]` does not contain `u`\).
* There are no parallel edges \(`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values\).
* If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` \(the graph is undirected\).
* The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` _if and only if it is **bipartite**_.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        Map<Integer, Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(i)) {
                continue;
            }
            Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
            queue.offer(i);
            map.put(i, true);
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                Integer curr = queue.poll();
                Boolean currColor = map.get(curr);
                int[] neis = graph[curr];
                for (int nei : neis) {
                    if (!map.containsKey(nei)) {
                        map.put(nei, !currColor);
                        queue.offer(nei);
                    } else if (map.get(nei) && currColor || !map.get(nei) && !currColor) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

/*
Use breadth-first search
Use a map to maintain visited node and corresponding color

For each node in the graph
    use a queue to do breadth-first search
    get the color of the current node
    check the color of each neighbor node and whether it's visited
    Case 1: unvisited
        put the node in the map with the color different from the color of the polled node
        add the node to the queue
    Case 2: visited
        Case 2.1: same color as the polled node
            return false
        Case 2.2: different color from the polled node
            do nothing

return true

V is the number of nodes in the graph, E is the number of edges
Time: O(V + E)
Space: O(V)
