# 694. Number of Distinct Islands

## Tips

* Mark grid\[i\]\[j\] as 0 so that the same cell will not be visited and processed again. No need to use a separate matrix to mark visited cells.
* Use DFS and string to record the path of visiting cells.
* Use a special character to record where we backtracked.

## Problem Description

Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s \(representing land\) connected 4-directionally \(horizontal or vertical.\) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of **distinct** islands. An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated \(and not rotated or reflected\) to equal the other.

class Solution {
    public int numDistinctIslands(int[][] grid) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    continue;
                }
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                dfs(grid, sb, i, j, '0');
                set.add(sb.toString());
            }
        }
        return set.size();
    }
    
    private void dfs(int[][] grid, StringBuilder sb, int x, int y, char dir) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= grid.length || y < 0 || y >= grid[0].length || grid[x][y] == 0) {
            return;
        }
        grid[x][y] = 0;
        sb.append(dir);
        dfs(grid, sb, x - 1, y, 'U');
        dfs(grid, sb, x + 1, y, 'D');
        dfs(grid, sb, x, y - 1, 'L');
        dfs(grid, sb, x, y + 1, 'R');
        sb.append('0');
    }
}
