# 71. Simplify Path

## Tips

* Be familiar with java string split\(\) method
* The corner case where the string builder is empty needs to be handled

## Problem Description

Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** \(starting with a slash `'/'`\) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes \(i.e. `'//'`\) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

* The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
* Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
* The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
* The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory \(i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`\)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

class Solution {
    public String simplifyPath(String path) {
        String[] arr = path.split("/");
        Deque<String> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (String str : arr) {
            if (str.isEmpty() || str.equals(".")) {
                continue;
            } else if (str.equals("..")) {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.pollLast();
                }
            } else {
                stack.offerLast(str);
            }
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            sb.append("/");
            sb.append(stack.pollFirst());
        }
        if (sb.length() == 0) {
            sb.append("/");
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
