# 946. Validate Stack Sequences

## Tips

* Check index out of bound and stack is empty before using stack and array

## Problem Description

Given two sequences `pushed` and `popped` **with distinct values**, return `true` if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        int N = pushed.length;
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < N || j < N) {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || popped[j] != stack.peekLast()) {
                if (i == N) {
                    return false;
                }
                stack.offerLast(pushed[i++]);
            } else {
                stack.pollLast();
                j++;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}


/*
Use two pointers, i and j, to iterate pushed and popped sequence
[i, end]: elements to be pushed
[j, end]: elements to be popped
Use a stack to store elements

For each time,
    Case 1: stack is empty or popped[j] != top element of stack
        if i out of bound, return false
        push pushed[i]
        i++
    Case 2: stack is not empty and poped[j] == top element of stack
        pop stack
        j++
Termination condition: i == n && j == n
return true

n is the number of elements
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
