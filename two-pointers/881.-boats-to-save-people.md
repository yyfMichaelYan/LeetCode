# 881. Boats to Save People

## Tips

## Problem Description

The `i`-th person has weight `people[i]`, and each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  \(It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.\)

class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int i = 0;
        int j = people.length - 1;
        int count = 0;
        while (i <= j) {
            int sum = people[i] + people[j];
            if (sum <= limit) {
                count++;
                i++;
                j--;
            } else {
                count++;
                j--;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
