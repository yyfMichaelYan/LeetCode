# 1662. Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent

## Tips

## Problem Description

Given two string arrays `word1` and `word2`, return __`true` _if the two arrays **represent** the same string, and_ `false` _otherwise._

A string is **represented** by an array if the array elements concatenated **in order** forms the string.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public boolean arrayStringsAreEqual(String[] word1, String[] word2) {
        int[] p1 = {0, 0};
        int[] p2 = {0, 0};
        while (p1[0] < word1.length && p2[0] < word2.length) {
            char ch1 = word1[p1[0]].charAt(p1[1]);
            char ch2 = word2[p2[0]].charAt(p2[1]);
            if (ch1 != ch2) {
                return false;
            }
            movePointer(p1, word1);
            movePointer(p2, word2);
        }
        return p1[0] == word1.length && p2[0] == word2.length;
    }
    
    private void movePointer(int[] p, String[] word) {
        if (p[1] != word[p[0]].length() - 1) {
            p[1]++;
        } else {
            p[0]++;
            p[1] = 0;
        }
    }
}


/*

Linearly scan the two arrays with two pointers
For each time, compare the characters of the two pointers
Case 1: Not equal
    return false
Case 2: equal
Move both pointers to the next one
    Case 2.1: both pointers have next position
        Move both pointers
    Case 2.2: only one pointer has next position
        return false
    Case 2.3: neither pointer has next position
        return true
Termination condition: at least one pointer has scanned all strings

How to tell if the current position has next position / How to move on to the next position
Case 1: the index is NOT the end of the current string
    index++
Case 2: the index is the end of the current string
    Case 2.1: the current string is not the last string
        move string to the next one
        index = 0
    Case 2.2: the current string is the last string
        no next position

n is the max length of the concatenated string
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)


For each pointer, two parameters are needed to describe it
1. which string
2. the index
