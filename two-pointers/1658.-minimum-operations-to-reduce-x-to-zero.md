# 1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero

## Tips

* This solution of two pointers only applies to the case where all elements are positive.
* The special case where x is equal to the total of all the elements needs to be taken care of.

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array `nums` and subtract its value from `x`. Note that this **modifies** the array for future operations.

Return _the **minimum number** of operations to reduce_ `x` _to **exactly**_ `0` _if it's possible, otherwise, return_ `-1`.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int x) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            total += num;
        }
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int globalMax = -1;
        while (right < nums.length) {
            sum += nums[right];
            while (left <= right && sum > total - x) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            if (sum == total - x) {
                globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, right - left + 1);
            }
            right++;
        }
        return globalMax == -1 ? -1 : nums.length - globalMax;
    }
}

/*
Find the longest subarray whose sum is equal to (total - x)

Use two pointers, left and right, to linearly scan the array in the same direction

For each time,
    move the right pointer by 1
    update the subarray sum
    if the subarray sum is equal to (total - x), update the length of the longest subarray
    while the subarray sum is greater than (total - x)
        move the left pointer by 1
Termination condition: the right pointer is out of bound

n is the length of nums
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
