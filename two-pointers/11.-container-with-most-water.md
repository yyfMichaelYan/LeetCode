# 11. Container With Most Water

## Tips

## Problem Description

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int globalMax = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]));
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return globalMax;

Proof of the correctness of the algorithm

Algorithm:
Use two pointers, s and e, that move towards each other.
Initialization: s = 0, e = height.length - 1
Case 1: a[s] <= a[e]
    s++
Case 2: a[s] > a[e]
    e--
Termination condition: s == e



Let's prove it by contradiction

Assume the max area is obtained by setting pointer s and pointer e to be l and r. In other words, a[l] and a[r] is the height of the left and right boundary line of the container.
For contradiction, assume that the pair of lines, <a[l], a[r]>, is not checked with the algorithm (missed), so the max area is not calculated.

To miss the optimal pair of lines, there are two possible cases.
Case 1: the pointer s passes by both l and r while the pointer e stays on the right of r
1 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
             s                                   e
2 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                s                                e
3 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                   s                             e
4 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                           s                     e
5 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                                    s            e
6 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                                       s         e
7 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                                          s      e
Explanation:
In step 1-7, the pointer s keeps moving towards e while e stays on the right of r, which means that a[i] <= a[e] for all i in [l-1, r+1].
For the optimal pair of lines, l and r, there are two possible cases.
    Case 1.1: a[l] <= a[r]
        The area between l and e is (e - l) * a[l] which is greater than the area between l and r which is (r - l) * a[l]
        e - l > r - l => (e - l) * a[l] > (r - l) * a[l]
        Contradiction!
    Case 1.2: a[l] > a[r]
        The area between l and r is (e - l) * a[l] which is greater than the area between l and r which is (r - l) * a[r]
        e-l > r-l and a[l] > a[r] => (e - l) * a[l] > (r - l) * a[r]
        Contradiction!

Case 2: the pointer s passes by l while the pointer e is on the right of r, and then the pointer e passes by r while s stays on the right of l
1 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
             s                            e
2 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                s                         e
3 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                   s                      e
4 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                   s                   e
5 ......l-2 l-1 l l+1 l+2......r-2 r-1 r r+1 r+2......
                   s                e
Explanation:
In step 1-3, the pointer s keeps moving towards e while e stays on the right of r until s == l + 1. This means that both a[l-1] and a[l] are less than a[e], while a[l+1] is greater than a[e]
For the optimal pair of lines, l and r, there are two possible cases.
    Case 2.1: a[l] <= a[r]
        The area between l and e, (e - l) * a[l], is greater than the area between l and r, (r - l) * a[l]
        e - l > r - l => (e - l) * a[l] > (r - l) * a[l]
        Contradiction!
    Case 2.2: a[l] > a[r]
        The area between l and e, (e - l) * a[l], is greater than the area between l and r, (r - l) * a[r]
        e - l > r - l and a[l] > a[r] => (e - l) * a[l] > (r - l) * a[r]
        Contradiction!

Therefore, the assumption that the optimal pair of lines, l and r, are missed is false, which means that with the algorithm, the optimal pair of lines will be checked and the max area will be calculated.
