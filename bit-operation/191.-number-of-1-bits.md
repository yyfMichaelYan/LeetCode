# 191. Number of 1 Bits

## Tips

* Be careful with off-by-one error \(number of bits to shift\).
* Every time n &= \(n - 1\) is executed, the number of 1 bit in the number decrement by 1.

## Problem Description

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has \(also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)\).

**Note:**

* Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3** above, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

**Follow up**: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Solution

### Loop

```text
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= 31; i++) {
            count += (n & 1);
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Optimized with Bit Manipulation Trick

```text
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count++;
            n &= (n - 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
