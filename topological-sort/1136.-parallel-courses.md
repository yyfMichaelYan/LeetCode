# 1136. Parallel Courses

## Tips

* For topological sort, use BFS, use a queue!!!!!
* Do not change elements while iterating its containers!!!!!
* When use getOrDefault\(\), DON'T forget to PUT the element BACK to the map!!!!!
* The length of the array of in degree should be n + 1

## Problem Description

You are given an integer `n` which indicates that we have `n` courses, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [a, b]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `a` and course `b`: course `a` has to be studied before course `b`.

In one semester, you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the prerequisites for the course you are studying.

Return _the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses_. If there is no way to study all the courses, return `-1`.

## Solution

```text
class Solution {
    public int minimumSemesters(int n, int[][] relations) {
        int[] indegree = new int[n + 1]; // ATTENTION
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> outMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] relation : relations) {
            int out = relation[0];
            int in = relation[1];
            indegree[in]++;
            List<Integer> list = outMap.getOrDefault(out, new ArrayList<>());
            list.add(in);
            outMap.put(out, list); // ATTENTION
        }
        Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>(); // ATTENTION
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            count++;
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                Integer out = queue.poll();
                List<Integer> list = outMap.getOrDefault(out, new ArrayList<>());
                for (Integer c : list) {
                    if (--indegree[c] == 0) {
                        queue.offer(c);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] != 0) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

/*
Step 1: iterate all relations
Create an array of in degrees
Create a map of out map

Step 2: breadth-first traversal
Use a queue to store all courses with in degrees of 0
For each semester,
    update semester count
    for each course with 0 in degree,
        for each course with this course as a prerequisite
            update its in degree
            if in degree becomes 0, push to queue
Termination condition: queue is empty
If all in degrees are 0, return semester count
Otherwise, return -1
